Naming Conventions (first half taken from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html)

Package names are written in all lower case to avoid conflict with the names of classes or interfaces.

Companies use their reversed Internet domain name to begin their package namesâ€”for example, com.example.mypackage for
a package named mypackage created by a programmer at example.com.

Name collisions that occur within a single company need to be handled by convention within that company,
perhaps by including the region or the project name
after the company name (for example, com.example.region.mypackage).

Packages in the Java language itself begin with java. or javax.

In some cases, the internet domain name may not be a valid package name. This can occur if the domain name
contains a hyphen or other special character, if the package name begins with a digit or other character that is
illegal to use as the beginning of a Java name, or if the package name contains a reserved
Java keyword, such as "int". In this event, the suggested convention is to add an underscore.
----------------------------------------------------------
Class Names and interfaces should use CamelCase
e.x. LinkedList

Method names and variables should use mixedCase
e.x. readValues

Constants should use UPPER_CASE
e.x. static final int MAX_INT

Type parameters are single character, capital letters
E - element
K - key
N - number
T - type
V - value
